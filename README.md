# Stack-in-C-plus-plus
Stack Implementation in C++ programming language via challenge scenario

A Stack has to be created with two methods **push** and **pop**. LinkedList class is used to keep track of the elements internally.

The input will consist of the number **t** followed by **t** test cases. Each test case will consist of a number __n__, followed by __n__ numbers of actual input.

For each number of the actual input, if the number is -1, pop off a value from your stack and print it. Otherwise, push the number onto your stack.

(Print all numbers for one line of input on one line of output.)

####Sample Input
```
4
9
3 5 -1 -1 2 7 11 -1 -1
14
3 5 -1 -1 2 7 9 -1 -1 5 -1 8 -1 -1
6
4 -1 5 -1 6 -1
16
1 2 3 -1 9 8 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 6 5 -1 -1 -1
```

####Sample Output
```
5 3 11 7
5 3 9 7 5 8 2
4 5 6
3 7 8 9 2 5 6 1
```
